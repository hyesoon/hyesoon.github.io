Hyesoon Kim is a Professor in the [College of Computing](https://www.cc.gatech.edu) at [Georgia Tech](https://www.gatech.edu/) and work with a bunch of a great stduents in her group [HPArch](https://sites.gatech.edu/hparch/).
She also serve as a co-director of [the Center for Research into Novel Computing Hierarchies (CRNCH)](https://crnch.gatech.edu/). 
She received a Ph.D. in Electrical Engineering and Computer Science from [University of Texas at Austin, Austin, Texas](https://www.utexas.edu/).


Her research areas include the intersection of computer architectures and compilers, with an emphasis on heterogeneous architectures such as GPUs and near-data processing. She is a recipient of the NSF Career Award and is a member of the MICRO/HPCA Hall of Fame. She is the chair of IEEE TCuARCH and an associate editor of Transactions on Architecture and Code Optimization. She is also an IEEE fellow. 

<!-- Tools to help programming and improving performance and energy efficiency of heterogeneous architectures are the main research topcis.  -->
